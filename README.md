# Lambdabot Reloaded

This is a version of Lambdabot, but for Discord. It is setup as a Docker container so that one can easily deploy it. To pull the container, you can use the following: 
```
docker pull ghcr.io/gnubufferoverflows/haskellbot:main
```
You need to set the environment variable `TOKEN` as your bot token when you run.

# How to Use

Run the command `>>=help` to see bot commands.

The original Lambdabot this was inspired from can be found here: https://wiki.haskell.org/Lambdabot
